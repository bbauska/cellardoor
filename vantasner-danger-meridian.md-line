The Vantasner Danger Meridian is the line past which danger increases exponentially to:

- the men and women who perform them.

Bram Vantasner explored this in his Sept. 2017 paper "The Vantasner Danger Meridian: Efficient Tool for Predicting Danger" (September 2017, Critical Horizons. In particular, the paper concerned left-minimal, anti-completely Ô¨Ånite triangles, the Lambert Case, and Artinian, and, of course, freely contra-covariant primes.
